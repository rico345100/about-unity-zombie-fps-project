Explain why I removed all Unity Zombie Co-op FPS projects.

I made and published Unity Project on Github a few years ago for free. I intended to help people who want to make zombie fps shooter with Unity. But today, I found a game that stole my resources without my permission and decided to remove it completely.

Here's the link for the game:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ARoganThing.ZombieCamp

He never contacted me to ask about using the resources in his game, and he just stollen. I already mentioned that some of the resources are not made by me, and there will be legal issues if you use them, but this guy just ignored them.

From now, I will no more share any Unity Project anymore because of this guy.
